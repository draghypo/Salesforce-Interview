                                                        Bulk API
                                                    -------------------

Bulk API: - It is used to process a large amount of data at once. means we can perform dml in bulk and it's run asynchronously.

  Usage: - Migrating data from another system into Salesforce and handle large amount of data.
     The main purpose of Bulk API is to quickly and efficiently process large volumes of data (like insert, update, delete, or query thousands/millions of records) in batches, 
        instead of one record at a time. 
    Insert:- just need to change the operation while creating job put insert.
    delete:- put delete
    query:- 

How Does It Work:- 
       1.Authenticate your salesforce get AccessToken:-  https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
       2. Now we need to create job through this url with post method with below body.
                          URL:- https://popcornapps-c-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v63.0/jobs/ingest
                          Method: - POST
                          Body:-                {
                                                  "operation" : "insert",
                                                  "object" : "Account",
                                                  "contentType" : "CSV",
                                                  "lineEnding" : "CRLF"
                                                  }

                                        Difference between LF and CRLF
                                      Line Ending	Stands for	Character(s) Used	Common On
                                     *. LF :- Stands for Line Feed	\n	Linux, macOS.
                                     *. CRLF :- stands for Carriage Return + Line Feed	\r\n	Windows systems.
                                      Note:- "LF" is for Mac/Linux line breaks (\n), while "CRLF" is for Windows line breaks (\r\n).
                              we will get reponse like that.
                                                  {
                                                      "id": "750J1000008Q7q8IAC",
