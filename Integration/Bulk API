                                                        Bulk API
                                                    -------------------

Bulk API: - It is used to process a large amount of data at once. means we can perform dml in bulk and it's run asynchronously.

  Usage: - Migrating data from another system into Salesforce and handle large amount of data.

How Does It Work:- 
       1.Authenticate your salesforce get AccessToken:-  https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
       2. Now we need to create job through this url with post method with below body.
                          URL:- https://popcornapps-c-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v63.0/jobs/ingest
                          Method: - POST
                          Body:-                {
                                                  "operation" : "insert",
                                                  "object" : "Account",
                                                  "contentType" : "CSV",
                                                  "lineEnding" : "CRLF"
                                                  }

                                        Difference between LF and CRLF
                                      Line Ending	Stands for	Character(s) Used	Common On
                                     *. LF :- Stands for Line Feed	\n	Linux, macOS.
                                     *. CRLF :- stands for Carriage Return + Line Feed	\r\n	Windows systems.
                                      Note:- "LF" is for Mac/Linux line breaks (\n), while "CRLF" is for Windows line breaks (\r\n).
                              we will get reponse like that.
                                                  {
                                                      "id": "750J1000008Q7q8IAC",
