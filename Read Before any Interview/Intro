Intro:- I am Md Sadique Alam, and I have 3 years of experience working as a Salesforce Developer. I have worked on several projects where I customized Salesforce solutions 
        using Apex, Lightning Web Components, and integrated Salesforce with external systems. I am comfortable working with both declarative and programmatic features and 
        hold the Salesforce Platform Developer I certification. I have collaborated closely with external teams and stakeholders to understand their requirements, build
        solutions that fit their needs, and provide demos to showcase the functionality.
