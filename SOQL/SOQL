                                                    ------------
                        
        SOQL: - Salesforce Object Query Language is a query language used in Salesforce to interact with the Salesforce database.  

        1. total count of Contacts for each account :- SELECT AccountId, COUNT(Id) FROM Contact GROUP BY AccountId

        2. Account does not have any contact: - SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Contact)

        3. Those account whose only close opportunity: -  

        4. About Nested Query: - select id,(select id from contacts),(select id from cases),(select id from opportunities),(select id from projects__r) from account limit 5
          explainations:- In nested queries,child object name should be in plural form.For standard objects(Contacts, Cases, Opportunities). For custom objects, append __r and use the plural form (Projects__r for a custom Project__c object).

        5. Account does not have any contacts:- Select Id,Name FROM Account where Id NOT IN (SELECT Accountid from contact)

        6. Account Atleas One contact: - Select Id,Name FROM Account where Id IN (SELECT Accountid from contact)

        7. Account does have atleas one contact and one opportunity:- Select Id,Name FROM Account where Id IN (SELECT Accountid from contact) AND Id IN (SELECT Accountid from opportunity)
            Notes:- {It will work for AND only for OR will get error "Semi join sub-selects are not allowed with the 'OR' operator"}

        8. Find second Highest Amount Opportunity: - Select Id,Amount FROM opportunity ORDER BY Amount DESC NULLS Last LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1 

        9. Latest Modified Account : - Select Id,Name FROM Account ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 1 

        10. All Accounts inculding Recyclebin : - Select Id,Name FROM Account ALL ROWS
            Notes:- {ALL ROWS That will work in code only not in salesforce inspetor , query inspector only in code that will work}.

        11. Fetch deleted Account from recycle bin:- SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE IsDeleted = TRUE ALL ROWS
              Note:- {This will work in code only not on qury editor, salesforce inspector}.

      12. Account does have more than 2 contacts:- SELECT AccountId, COUNT(Id) FROM Contact GROUP BY AccountId HAVING COUNT(Id) > 2

      13.Order of Execution soql quey:- SELECT Name, COUNT(Id) FROM Account WHERE Industry = 'Chemicals' GROUP BY Name HAVING COUNT(Id) > 0 ORDER BY Name ASC LIMIT 10
        
            1️⃣ FROM Clause: First, Salesforce identifies the object you’re querying (e.g., Account).
            2️⃣ WHERE Clause: Then, it applies any filters (e.g., Industry = 'Technology') to narrow down the records.
            3️⃣ GROUP BY Clause: Next, Salesforce groups the results based on specified fields (e.g., Name).
            4️⃣ HAVING Clause: After grouping, it further filters the grouped data (e.g., COUNT(Id) > 1).
            5️⃣ SELECT Clause: At this stage, Salesforce defines the fields to return (e.g., Name, COUNT(Id)) but processes them after the filtering and grouping steps.
            6️⃣ ORDER BY Clause: Next, Salesforce sorts the results (e.g., ORDER BY Name ASC).
            7️⃣ LIMIT Clause: Finally, the query limits the number of records returned (e.g., LIMIT 10).

       14. LIKE Operator in SOQL:-  Select Id,Name from Account where name Like '%pagi%'

                    Summary:  Below follow case-insensitive..
                    %Pagi% matches any name that contains "Pagi" anywhere. even in middle.
                    Pagi% matches any name that starts with "Pagi". String must be start with Pagi.
                    %Pagi matches any name that ends with "Pagi".   Strig must be end with Pagi.

      15.Show the All fields of Account:- select Fields(All) from Account Limit 200. if limit will be not used will get an error " The SOQL FIELDS function must have a LIMIT of at most 200"
      16. Show All the Custom Fields only:- select Fields(Custom) from Account Limit 200. if limit will be not used will get an error " The SOQL FIELDS function must have a LIMIT of at most 200"
      17. Show All the Standard fields only: - select Fields(Standard) from Account. No Limit Required.
      18. Date:- SELECT Id, Name from Account WHERE CreatedDate < last_N_DAYS:1

      ** Dynamic query Practice: - 
 public static void dynamicQuery() {
        String query = 'Select id,name from account where name=\'Paginator1\'';
        List<Account> accList = Database.query(query);
        System.debug('query sadiq size'+accList.size());
    }
    public static void dynamicQuery1() {
        String name = 'Paginator1';
        String ann = '2001';
        String query = 'SELECT id, name FROM Account WHERE name = \'' + name + '\' AND AnnualRevenue = ' + ann;
        List<Account> accList = Database.query(query);
        System.debug('query sadiq size'+accList.size());
    }
    public static void dynamicQuery2(String name,String ann) {
        String query = 'SELECT id, name FROM Account WHERE name = \'' + name + '\' AND AnnualRevenue = ' + ann;
        List<Account> accList = Database.query(query);
        System.debug('query sadiq size'+accList.size());
    }
