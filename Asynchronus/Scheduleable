 												APEX SCHEDULER
											  -------------------
   			Apex Scheduler:-  To schedule an apex class to run on specific time.
			
				Note:- {The Schedulable interface contains one method that must be implemented, execute.
							example:- global void execute(SchedulableContext sc){} 
							method either could be a global or public only}

				syntax:- global class ScheduledBatchable implements Schedulable {
   							global void execute(SchedulableContext sc) {
    						 // do your operations
   							}
						}

						scheduled through corn expression from anonymous windows.

 			example:-
                        public class scheduleExample  implements schedulable{
                            public static void execute(SchedulableContext sc) {
                                Account acc = new Account();
                                acc.name = 'Table Tennis'+System.now();
                                insert acc;
                            }
						}
                            
                           corn expression   ==> schedule from anonymous window and see in apex job in setup
                           scheduleExample sc = new scheduleExample();
                           String tim = '0 40 * * * ?';
                           System.schedule('give your job name', tim, sc);
