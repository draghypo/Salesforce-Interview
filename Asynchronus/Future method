 												FUTURE METHOD
											  -----------------
	
		future method:-  it is used to run large job separetly means independent.
							example:- webservices, large dml operation etc.

			Point of future method:-
									a). future method support only primitive parameter.not support sobject.but to achieve that
											just do searilization and pass will work.
									b). future method does not give the job id.
									c). future method can not be called from the future method.
									d). future method must be static and support only void return type.
									e). to call a future method from schedule apex, trigger, for web service we need to @future(callout=true).
									f). with in transaction we can call 50 future methods.

			why we use future method:- 
                  a).To perform a callout from trigger to avoid the exception.
									b). To run the asynchornous process. let's understand with exmple if we decalre method with
											future that will give log separately not dependent on the other.
											example:- 
												=> normal method  compare with below future method with output.

                                                        public static void meth2(){
                                                            system.debug('futurecall-1');
                                                            system.debug('futurecall-2');
                                                        }
                                                        public static void meth1() {
                                                            system.debug('normalcall-1');
                                                            meth2();
                                                            System.debug('normalcall-2');
                                                        }
                                                    }
     								Output: - calling meth1();    normalcall-1, futurecall-1, futurecall-2, normalcall-2

											public class Future_Method_Example {
                                                @future
                                                public static void meth2(){
                                                    system.debug('futurecall-1');
                                                    system.debug('futurecall-2');
                                                }
                                                public static void meth1() {
                                                    system.debug('normalcall-1');
                                                    meth2();
                                                    System.debug('normalcall-2');
                                                }
                                            }
									Output: - calling meth1():-  2log will come. output will be separate.



									c). To handle the Mixed Dml exception:- while doing a dml operation on setup object and non
										setup object then it will throw an exception Mixed Dml operation to avoid that need a
										future method because it's run indepently.
